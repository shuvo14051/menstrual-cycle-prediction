# Predicting Menstrual Cycle Analysis using Machine Learning
## About
This repository contains a project focused on predicting menstrual cycle and ovulation days of women using machine learning techniques. The project aims to address the challenge of tracking menstrual cycles, especially for those with irregular cycles, by leveraging predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains extensive information related to menstrual cycles. It consists of 80 columns and was sourced from Marquette University's e-Publications. The dataset has been cleaned to prepare it for analysis and model training. However, the original uncleaned dataset is also provided for reference.
